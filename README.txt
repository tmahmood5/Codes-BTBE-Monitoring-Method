This file contains codes to reproduce the results of our paper Zwetsloot et al. (2021). The Section 1 consists of all functions to generate average time-to-signal (ATS)
for BTBE chart. The functions to obtained ATS for BTBE chart under Gumbel's Bivariate Exponential (GBE) distribution are given in Section 1.1 and 1.2.
Further, the functions for the ATS value of BTBE chart under Marshall Olkin Bivariate Exponential (MOBE) and Marshal Olkin Bivariate Weibull (MOBW) distributions
are given in Section 1.3 and 1.4, respectively.

For the practioniers, examples to estimate TS for BTBE chart under bivariate lifetime distributions are provided in Section 2. The example for ATS of BTBE chart under GBE distribution 
is given in section 2.1 while example for ATS of BTBE chart under MOBE and MOBW distributions are provided in Section 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.
